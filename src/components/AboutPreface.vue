    <p>
      A school building’s four walls do not make the heart of the structure.  The people within do; the teachers, building caretakers, students, parents, and community members bond together to educate the next generations.  Plato and Socrates said it best; education is a means to achieve both individual and social justice, excellence in virtue, and self-awareness.  Plato firmly believed when social classes in work together and give all people equal educational opportunity from an early age will compete fairly with each other.

      As an educator for over 34 years, I know firsthand education of the next generations takes everyone in a child’s life.  When I first moved to Crawfordsville, I only knew Tuttle Middle School.  I slowly branched out and visited the other schools, learning their history.  No one mentioned Lincoln School for Colored Children.  It was almost 20 years later when I first learned of the existence of not only one building, but two.
