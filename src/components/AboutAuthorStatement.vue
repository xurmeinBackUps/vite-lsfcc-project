    <p>Dilemma, Dilemma</p>
    <p>
      Having grown up deep in Alabama during 1970’s Desegregation, I felt firsthand the tension among ethnic backgrounds.  At that time, political correctness struggled with the proper name for those of African descent.  The dilemma still exists; African-American, Black, people of color, colored, Negro- none of the books I read as I prepared to write held a distinct pattern, so I chose to poll many people of various ethnic backgrounds as to their preference, research trends, and email experts.  As I learned from this research, Negro is a dated term, colored and people of color refers to all those not Caucasian, African American assumes descent from Africa.  So, meaning no offense to anyone, I chose the terms Black and Mulatto since those terms were used in most United States censes of that time period.  However, when quoting historical sources, I stayed true to the author.

      Another dilemma presented itself when deciding how to refer to those who chose to leave their life of slavery.  While researching, I discovered a controversy brewing over exactly how to refer to these individuals.  Today we call them human beings; then, various names included runaways, runaway slaves, indentured servants, contraband, freedom seekers, Underground Railroad travelers, enslaved Africans, fugitives- the list seems to grow daily.  Rather than choose just one, I chose the one that best described each unique situation.

      I present the bibliographies differently than other works.  With hundreds of Ancestry.com references, it became obvious to me that the easiest way to share the resources I used was to compile a list after each section.  The complete list of resources can be found at the back of the book.

      Any and all mistakes contained within this work are mine and mine alone.

      I hope you enjoy a snippet of Montgomery County’s inspiring past as much as I loved writing it.
