		Lincoln School Building 1
		1881
		In 1881 the Crawfordsville School Trustees ordered an all-Black school be built at the southwest corner of Spring and North Walnut Streets to serve Black students in grades 1-8. Once graduating from Lincoln, the students attended the integrated Crawfordsville High School. This site accommodated the cast majority of Black families living in Crawfordsville’s Northend. The Trustees purchased the lot in September 1881 for the sum of $2000. On 3 December 1881, Hinckley and Norris won the contract to build the building for $6400. The architects designed a plain two-story red brick structure, with playgrounds for all the Black children that resided in that area. Lincoln School officially opened in September 1882 with 42 students.
		The following Crawfordsville newspaper articles trace the discussions, debates, dilemmas, and the disputes the local citizenry faced as Lincoln School staff members educated Black and Mulatto children in separate and unequal facilities, and the challenges Black students faced when attended an integrated high school after graduating from Lincoln School for Colored Children.
		1890
		On 3 May 1890, the Crawfordsville Review printed the following article, “Civil Rights in the Public Schools”. need 1890 yearbook
		“A strange and paradoxical arrangement is now being made among the pupils of the high school. The graduating class of 1890 has agreed to shut out a couple of young Negroes from any of the privileges which are supposed to follow in the wake of an education secured in the free schools of Crawfordsville. The girls comprising the present class declined to have these two colored boys present at their annual banquet, and this refusal is based solely on the fact that they are “Niggers”. The thought is horrifying in the extreme, and the fair bosoms of the graduates heave with indignation when the question broached. Various means have been resorted to by them in order to sidetrack the two “Niggers” but all have failed. The strange part of the whole thing is that the girls all are from staunch Republican families where, of course, they have been taught from infancy that the White man was almost as good as a Negro. They have been taught that the outrages alleged to have been committed upon the intelligent Blacks of the South, were offenses unpardonable in the sight of God and man, and that every Southern Democrat who objected to allowing the Negro to mingle in the company which thronged his parlors, was fit only for Judge Lynch. These girls have read these things, they have heard all who are opposed to Negro equality held up to scorn, and now are showing the blackest of ingratitude by placing their French heels on the neck of Sambo and Juba, and defying Africa in the Civil Rights Bill, daring them to attempt to avert the calamity. The class, a few years ago, objected to a young colored man making his graduation speech and had him shut off, the trustees and principal taking a hand. It is a shame to our boasted freedom when any good citizen is denied the privileges accorded him by the laws of the land; when a set of young girls dictate terms to a set of officials and trample law underfoot. These colored boys have rights under law which must be respected. They are on the same footing with every other graduate of the city high school. They are entitled to a voice in every association of that school’s alumni, and none dare molest nor make them afraid. In Mississippi, among the heathen and, bloodthirsty cutthroats and rubble Democrats it could be done, but in Indiana, never. Here is where freedom lives and thrives. Does it? These girls went to the same teachers, in the same rooms, and will graduate on the same night from the same stage as these two colored boys or ”Niggers”. The school officials should have stiffer backbones. They should have that stern unbending willpower which have hung a Southerner for hiding a Negro who was caught stealing his corn; who would flay said Southerner alive if he got mad when a Negro was caught kissing his wife. This is the sort of stuff true, loyal Northerners are made of. The school board must stamp out the spirit of rebellion in the breasts of these handsome daughters of Athens and make them treat the “Niggers” as their equals. Such is the consistency of the teaching of the Republican Party. The Lord may know what it is made of but the devil has better opportunity.
		Seven days later, The Crawfordsville Weekly Journal, fired back justifying these actions by publishing “Civil Rights in the Public Schools”. The Review of last Saturday devotes nearly a column to what might be appropriately termed unadulterated rot to the alleged wrongs of the Negroes in the public schools of the city. The wrongs refer to are wholly imaginary and have no foundation in fact as they relate to the schools proper, the pupils, the teachers or the school board. The two colored boys who will graduate this spring have been accorded exactly the same treatment from the time they entered the primary class until now and will receive until when they get their diplomas that have been accorded the white pupils. In all their intercourse during their school years these two boys have received the most considerate in the most courteous treatment at the hands of their white classmates. The girls have shown themselves to be ladies in the highest sense of the term upon every occasion and in all places. They have not dictated, neither have they sought to dictate, terms to the officials. No law has been trampled underfoot by either pupils, teachers, or trustees. Both board and teachers have seen to it that the law was enforced in letter and spirit. And the young colored gentlemen have had any cause for complaint, neither have they made any complaint. With their graduation the responsibilities of both board and teachers end. The banqueting, and dancing, and the social festivities which follow are no part of the curriculum. The law does not contemplate they shall be. Civil rights laws nor any other law presumes to interfere with the rights of individuals in the choice of their associates or to regulate social affairs. So far as the political capital the Review seeks to make that pink of consistency is reminded that the Republican Party assumes all the responsibility for the legislation which gives to colored children the privileges of an education on equal terms with white children. The law was enacted by a Republican legislature and approved by a Republican governance. Not a Democrat in either the House or the Senate voted for the bill. But on the other hand, it was most bitterly assailed by the entire Democratic Party. And have the Democrats of Indiana been in power there would have been no colored graduates from any of our high schools. Every Lincoln School building in Indiana is a monument to the justice, the liberality, the philanthropy of the Republican Party in its aims to ennoble and elevate the human race.
		While the names of the Black students remain unknown until an 1890 Crawfordsville high school yearbook can be located, the Crawfordsville Daily Journal 30 May 1890 published what appears to be the final chapter in the story. ”Social gatherings are becoming a fixed thing as far as commencement exercises are concerned to be given any honor of the two colored graduates. Besides the banquet given by the C E C June 6, Mrs. Aaron McCree will give a reception at her home, and on June 9, Mrs. Maggie Jones will entertain them at her home, and besides there are others who will entertain also, but for a cause best known to them don’t want their names put before the public”.
		Apparently, in August of 1890, at the beginning of the school year, the school trustees attempted full integration. Details are sketchy, but by October, the local newspapers decried the experiment. The Crawfordsville Daily Journal 4 October 1890 reported that “the colored children who were temporarily placed among the White children will be placed back at the Lincoln School house. It will be many moons before the school board will ever try the mixing experiment again. A colored substitute has been secured temporarily”. That substitute seems to have been Miss Anna Kraut, sister of suffragist and author Mary Hannah Kraut.
		1892
		Desegregation again reared its head in April 1892. The Crawfordsville Daily Journal reported “Unnecessary alarm. Two or three colored gentlemen about the city are exercised over nothing. Someone, probably a mischief maker, circulated the report that the colored children were to be removed from their building to make way for the white children. White children will attend the school with the colored children will in no wise be disturbed. There are only 30 colored children attending the school and in the emergency the vacant rooms have to be utilized. Anyone who objects to this is worse than a fool”.
		As in the usual back and forth in the newspapers, the Crawfordsville Daily Journal, 8 April 1892, offered an explanation of their rival’s words after interviewing Reverend L Pettiford, pastor of the AME Church, explaining, “In last evening’s issue of the Journal, there appeared an article headed “Unnecessary Alarm” stating that probably a mischief maker, circulated the report that the colored children were be to removed from their building to make way for the white children. The article represented the above statement as being groundless. The above is not the report of a mischief maker, nor is it without foundation, unless you will admit your superintendent is a mischief maker and that there is no veracity in his word. For he, the superintendent, did positively meet the pastor of the AME Church on the corner of Main Street and Wabash Avenue and requested him to see the trustees of said church and ascertain of them as to whether they would rent the back room of their church for school purposes. The pastor asked him what class he intended to put in the said room if it could be obtained. He stated that he wanted to put Mr. Davis, the colored teacher, and his pupils in the said room. Also stating that he wanted to utilize the entire building for the White children for convenience. The trustees of the said church refused to rent the room probably on this ground. These are the facts of the unnecessary alarm. We are not mischief makers but law-abiding citizens, and only want the rights awarded us that belong to us as such, and this we have a right to, and will contend for when our rights are infringed upon. The writer of set article closed by saying that they only wished to utilize the vacant room in an emergency and anyone that would object to this is worse than a fool I think I can safely assert that there is not a colored citizen that will object. So then this will exculpate us and it stands then that we are not fools in this case. No, I thank God that we have no such prejudice against the predominant race”
		This article which appeared in yesterday's Journal was made on the authority of Henry Campbell, one of the trustees, and Professor Wellington, superintendent, both of them stated that it was never their intention to remove the colored children unless the colored citizens were perfectly willing. It was desired for the sake of convenience to get the graded rooms together at the Lincoln Schools and the board of the AME Church was offered $50 for the rent of the back room in order that the 30 pupils of Professor Davis might be accommodated there. The proposition was made only on the condition that the colored people should freely consent, and when they objected it was dropped and other arrangements were made. In view of all the facts, suppressing none, the Journal still thinks there was an unnecessary alarm. After the matter had been dropped and the colored people were so assured, the person who circulated the report cannot be considered in any other light than a mischief maker.
		1892
		By September 1892, the Crawfordsville Daily Journal reported the growing discontent among the local Black population about the education and discipline their children were receiving at the Lincoln School. Part of the concern was the drop in enrollment from 107 students in 1886 to just 51 in 1892. By 1893, the local newspapers told stories of students being harshly disciplined by both Professor Davis and Professor Chavis who had both recently resigned. Students leaving Lincoln after eighth grade often found the transition to the White high school very difficult. Finances became a concern as each pupil taught at the Lincoln School cost $30 a year compared to just $8 for each student in one of the other buildings. According to school records, 60 pupils would begin the year at Lincoln School but only 30 would remain at the end although admittedly weather hindered students’ attendance because some had to walk from so far away. The difficulty of hiring efficient colored teachers became a huge concern for Black residents. Integration again crept back into the conversation, but that suggestion met with stiff opposition.
		1893
		Again, questions about integration swirled as the price of educating all students continued to rise. The Crawfordsville Review 1 July 1893 printed and article entitled “Will they mix? The city school board is entertaining and idea of mixing Blacks and Whites. Opinions range from “It won’t work” “It’s a first-rate idea” “It will break up the schools”, “It should have been done long ago”, “It will give the private schools a boom”. The above are only a few of the comments heard on every hand concerning the school board’s recent action in regard to disbanding the colored schools altogether and mixing them among the Whites. The Review interviewed Dr. Cowan and a member of the board Thursday who said ”Yes, such is the talk. It’s the general opinion of the entire board that the move would be a good thing and save the city thousands of dollars. Of course we haven’t taken definite action in the matter as yet, and will not until we get the sentiment of the people. In the first place we must have more room for scholars. The enumeration shows 280 more children of school age this year than last and we must provide a place for them. Now there are four rooms in the colored school building, while but two of them are occupied. By making it a ward school we could utilize these two extra rooms to a great advantage. There are but 60 colored children who attend school and by distributing them around they would not average quite two to each room. It would be a saving to the city of at least $1000 per year, and that is what we are after. But bear in mind, nothing is as yet settled; we simply wanted opinion of the people first, then we will act”. We had scarcely gotten downstairs when we heard an enraged citizen, and a good Republican too, by the way, express herself thus “blankety-blank such a school board. I’ll see em in ----- before I allow my children to attend school with a blankety-blank nigger”. And so it goes, while the end is not yet.
		As in past situations, the Crawfordsville Weekly Journal 22 July 1893 replied with its own version of the situation in an article entitled, “No mixed schools”. The article made it clear schools would be integrated. “Dark skinned mother” and “patron” can dry up for now the question of the co-education of race and Crawfordsville. It has been settled for the ensuing year at least. The school board held a meeting Monday and after carefully canvassing the matter decided to maintain separate schools for the next year. This conclusion seemed warranted by circumstances. The board was rather inclined to favor the abolition of the Lincoln Colored School and the distribution of the colored children through the several other schools according to the location. If this had been done the Lincoln School would have been refitted for white children and the small contingency of Negroes in the Northend. Investigation showed, however, that there were not enough white children in the Northend and to maintain the school and make it profitable, children would have to be brought from out of the south end. The greatest objections to such a state of affairs were plainly manifest so it was decided to retain the Lincoln Colored School in all its pristine glory and magnificence. It was considered mete however, to dispense with the services of a colored teacher. Those tried in late years have been notoriously inefficient, not to say ridiculous. A thoroughgoing and brawny white teacher will be turned loose up at the Lincoln School and it will be seen if he can’t bring some good out of Nazareth”
		1894
		In May 1894, the school board and trustees realized there were too many students and too few seats in the schools. A decision was made to construct another building for $18,000 which meant money needed to be cut elsewhere to finance the project. Lincoln School again came under fire as documents showed that the Black children did not make the proper progress that they should have made while attending. Rumors swirled that the teachers had lost control. Citizens could not decide where to place the blame; teachers, school trustees, or students. Most agreed that if the blame lay with the students, the blame lay with the parents as well. If with lay with the teacher, the remedy included a change in teachers.
		The school trustees had employed both White and Black teachers up to this point with mixed results. The Black population did not agree; they wanted Black teachers for their students and held public meetings to protest against the action of the board. A committee was appointed to draft demands to be presented to the school trustees. The trustees, however, declined to make any changes. Some Crawfordsville citizens thought the best solution to be the entire abolition of separate schools and Black students sent to the Central, Mills, and Willson buildings. With mixed classrooms, it was believed students would have improved discipline and a better education. Some citizens suggested visits to Frankfurt, Lebanon, Greencastle and other towns in Indiana that have had success with integration.
		School officials discussed, debated and deliberated about the integration once again and emerged with a different suggestion; all students would all be in the same building, but the Black children would be in completely different rooms and areas of the building than the White children.
		With this announcement, the Black community had had enough and decided the time had come to take drastic action. The Crawfordsville Daily Journal reported on the mass meeting held at the Second Baptist Church that Black residents held in response to this new idea of integration. While all in attendance wanted changes, the greatest fear among the attendees was that Crawfordsville School System would cut ties with Lincoln School and it would be entirely on its own. At the end of the lengthy meeting, the following resolutions were adopted.
		Where as it is known to us patrons of Lincoln school and the citizens of Crawfordsville that the Board of School Trustees has again ignored our needs and desires in the appointment of teachers for the ensuing school year and,
		Whereas the right to appeal for redress is ours by the laws governing our land it is therefore.
		Resolved. That we hear with astonishment that the school officials of the city, the home of intelligence and wealth, the Athens of Indiana have not gained from experience nor considered in the spirit of justice in their relationship as guardians of the education of our children, and so much that they had again deliberately appointed a teacher who is persona non-grata and it is
		Resolved. That we notice with alarm the great indifference manifested toward us in the exercising of proper care and interest in education, leaving us to think and believe that the school set aside for our use have lost their savor of usefulness being quite inferior in many respects to the other schools of the city and it is.
		Resolved. That the Honorable Board of School Trustees do hereby be requested to take steps to looking toward a betterment of the teaching ability in our schools, and we further request for the sake of harmony that where competency or incompetency must govern teachers of color be given preference since the same rule applies in the other schools, and let it be further
		Resolved. That as citizens and patrons we shall do what can be done to improve the conditions for educating our children, letting our support to any effort that is right and proper that we deplore the necessity of this meeting though recognizing its importance: that a committee be appointed to wait on the Board of Trustees, laying before that body our grievance. A committee was appointed to lay the grievances before the school trustees, and another committee to see the lady appointed to teach that she might be informed of the widespread dissatisfaction
		Hearing nothing for two months, the Black Community again took action proposing to send their students to other local schools. The Crawfordsville Daily Journal 29 August 1894 an article appeared entitled, “Into the Courts”. According to those interviewed, “The school question will be decided by the courts, say the colored people”. An attendee furnished the newspaper with a report of another meeting of the black community with school officials held at the Bethel AME Church. “Last night a meeting was held at the AME Church to hear the report of the committee that visited the school board. The school board declined to heed the prayers of the petitioners in any particular, giving no reason at all for its action. The colored citizens that once began active preparations for getting their rights in the school by recourse to higher powers than the school board. The following resolution was passed
		Whereas the colored people of the city duly met and appointed a committee to await on the school trustees to ask for better school facilities for their children and
		Whereas, the school trustees have declined to afford such facilities or to grant any request made it is.
		Resolved. That we, the patrons of the public school will on the opening of the school send our children to the nearest schoolhouse and in case of their non-admission to begin legal proceedings to establish our rights under the law. A committee on permanent organization reported the selection of the following officers: Pres. George Oliver. Vice president Mrs. Cassie Day, Sec. Miss Sarah Woodfork, treasurer Robert T Hopkins. Standing committee EW Robinson, Lemuel Gipson, Joseph Peake, Toliver Hawkins, Zach Williams, R Frank Patterson, John Bias, F Francis, William Pierce, and Reverend Pettiford.
		The Crawfordsville School Board and Trustees refused to responded. So, the Black citizenry attended a school board meeting which the Crawfordsville Weekly Journal 31 August 1894 covered and printed the intimate details. “The Crawfordsville School Board of Trustees held a meeting August 23, the object being to hear the grievances of the colored people in regard to their schools and to ascertain whether or not they were well-founded. The following was read by Lincoln School Professor E B Allen, “to the board of school trustees: gentlemen – in accordance with the desire of the colored citizens expressed in a mass meeting, called for the purpose of discussing better arrangements and greater efficiency in the education of the colored children of the city, we, the committee appointed to lay grievances of the colored people before your honorable body to respectfully submit the following.
		One. It is our opinion based upon observation and inquiry that it is impossible to give adequate and profitable instruction to the colored children of the city with one teacher.
		Two. That the inability of one teacher to instruct satisfactorily is further increased by the division of the pupils into eight grades, necessarily forming many classes and giving to each class very inadequate portion of time for recitation. This is an opinion most prevalent among the patrons and citizens in general.
		Three. We believe that under proper encouragement at least a large percent of the colored children should be brought into the school rooms permanently. By proper encouragement is meant, the full complement of teachers essential for efficient work and a wise close supervision over the instruction by the school officials.
		Four. It is our opinion that the statutes of law affecting public schools to single he prescribed that any quality of instruction must be given white and color children by school districts and school Corporation. We know that under present conditions this equality is not maintained.
		Five. It needs no argument to prove there for colored children, colored teachers are manifestly superior to white teachers since the latter have no sympathy in common with colored children, do not associate at home, at church or on the street with colored patrons and are diametrically opposed in conduct and natural feeling. Colored teachers are employed in all cities where colored schools are maintained, and this alone is sufficient to prove the argument for them.
		Six. And in the further exercise of the duty involved upon us, we do most respectfully present to your honorable body these interrogatives.
		I.Is it an indifference to the needs of the color children, or a conclusion that they do not require the same degree of attention given to white children?
		II. By employing white teachers in the face of colored applicants is it concluded that a more successful work can be done; that colored patrons are more likely to cooperate in making the school a success?
		III. is it not your desire to so construct your system that all parts work uninterruptedly, that it should be harmonious?
		IV. Is it your intention to maintain a separate school which will be so conducted as to be a laughing stock of the town, a target of gibes for schoolboys?
		V. what is the reason the request and desires of the patrons of the school are ignored? Surely it is not suppose that the school can be made a success when 99% of the patrons are determinedly opposed to it? In addition we lay before you, gentlemen, the following requests:
		a. The employment of at least two teachers, one male and one female.
		b. The teachers to be acceptable to the patrons and able thereby to gain the goodwill of the children.
		c. The maintenance of the colored school in charge of color teachers or the abandonment of all separation on account of color.
		d. That a speedy understanding is necessary if the forthcoming school year is to be a success or a failure.
		It did not take much time for the Crawfordsville School Board to respond. They refused to change and continue with just one White teacher for all grades. In response, the Black population protested.
		For several years, one teacher did teach all six grades in one room which allowed the only one hour with each class. After a couple more years of discussion, disappointment, and dissention, in 1896, two teachers were hired; one taught the primary grades, the other the secondary grades.
		Of course with all good schools, come great stories. A fake ghost was once said to haunt the property. The Crawfordsville Weekly Journal 26 February 1897 reported “a good deal of excitement has been occasioned in the North and for the last few evenings by the regular appearance of a ghost. This ghost is a married woman it is said by knowing ones, and unless she curves her desire to masquerade it is likely that she will eventually land in jail. She goes gabbing about with the sheet over her head and information is to the effect that her object is the tracking of a young man, for whom she has an attachment and who is too attentive to another woman. Wednesday night the ghost ran into George McDonald as he and a friend were strolling through the yard of the Lincoln school. George and his friend took flight and hunting up Officer Bannister had him search for the apparition. She had vanished into thin air however”
		And in the Crawfordsville Review 25 September 1897, “Andrew Gray is a Teamster about town. He is industrious when he can find employment but when idle loves to tarry at the wine cup. Saturday seems to have been one of his off days. He “got ull” that evening on corn juice, and along after dark concluded that it would be a good time to leave this vale of sorrow and tears by killing himself. He was missed and the police sent for. Going there about 9 o’clock to his home near the Lincoln school building he was found hanging to the lamb of a tree, his feet touching the ground and his breath almost gone. Upon being rescued from his position he soon revived, but in a few moments more it would have been “all day” with him. He was strangling to death. Gray has attempted self-destruction hereto for, it is said, and may eventually succeed in separating soul from body if he persisted in his efforts. Andrew seemed to have difficulties staying sober as he had been fined several times for intoxication and ending up behind bars.
		1901
		In December 1901, Lincoln School was again a subject of concern that unused space and rising costs of educating Black students separately was disproportionately costing the school district money while the other buildings were overfull. In response, the Crawfordsville School Board and Trustees requested an issuance of bonds to erect a new school building again due to overcrowding. After the funds were denied, the newspapers quoted school officials as saying “we have done our duty in the matter and can rest conscience clear. We did not rush in there without deliberation and asked the council to expend a large sum of money. We looked at the matter from every standpoint and we are still satisfied that our view was the right view. We believe the step a necessary one but feel relieved, of course, that we are spared the responsibility and trouble of building a new school house. It is not likely that the Lincoln School will be made a white school. Its location is a very grave objection to such a step and there are many citizens who would not send their children there. We shall worry along as we have been worrying”
		1909-1922
		After the building had stood for more than 28 years, a small addition to Lincoln School was added and the equipment upgraded. Black and White students remained segregated. However, the school’s activities still made the newspapers. In 1916, the Lincoln School students “put on an unforgettable music performance under the leadership of Blanche Woody. Professor Heinz, chairman of the Montgomery County Centennial Committee, was so impressed with the fine voices that he asked the children be put on the Centennial Program. 11 children graduated that year from the eighth grade”.
		The newspapers reported that George W Thompson, principal, “summed up the situation best when he told his students that opportunities were never better for the African-American whose conduct is above reproach and who proves himself to his community” need the year
		Eventually the Black population shifted from the Northend to the East End, and Lincoln School Building 1 became obsolete and abandoned. The red brick structure was eventually renovated and renamed Horace Mann School which reopened for both Blacks and Whites. Horace Mann operated smoothly for many years, but after newer schools were built, the building was abandoned at the end of the 1957 58 school year and completely demolished in 1964.
